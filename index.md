## << DISCLAMER: CURRENTLY NOT ALL TASKS ARE READY. >>

Welcome to our learning comunity. Here you can find out [tasks](/tasks) that will help you to get practice on DevOps. You can try to complete any task that you feel comfortable with. If you have any troubles feel free to contact us in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/f2wWxZfKSJ).

## Idea

The idea is following: I'm posting a quest and give details for it. Then people try to make this quest. I will gonna play "customer" role and will not give any manuals. You can google how to do it, read books, reddit, stack overflow, view youtube videos - whatever you want. I will answer your questions in comments and give my feedback. So you gonna learn by doing stuff rather then reading and copy pasting.

## History

When I started my way in administration, then in DevOps jobs I had great mentors who helped me to with learning a lot of things on practice. Later after getting more senior level I started to prepare on-boarding materials for newcomers, so that people who joined our team in 2 month become productive.

Right now I would like to do something similar and prepare materials for training for people that would like to try out technical tools and practices from DevOps.
