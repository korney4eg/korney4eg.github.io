You probably know programm [ps](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html), that allow to see a lot of information about given process. Your task would be to write bash script that will get `pid` (process id) and shows following information:

<!--more-->

* who run this process
* what command was used to run process
* what environment variables this process knows
* what files curretrly open by this process

All this information you need to get without using `ps` command or `*top`.

## Tips

* Check out how to make bash script work with arguments
* Check out Linux filesystem structure
