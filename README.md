Plan:

Phase 1. Linux administration. Virtual Machines. Automation.

2. Automating building and starting up containers.
3. Setup CI/CD tool to build images, start containers.
4. Scripting in CI/CD.

Phase 3. Kubernetes. Monitoring

0. Start k8s locally. Try to run single pod there.
1. Run blog engine on k8s.
2. Setup monitoring in K8s.
4. Horisontal autoscaling and load tests.

Phase 4.(Optional). Run in Public Cloud. Terraform
