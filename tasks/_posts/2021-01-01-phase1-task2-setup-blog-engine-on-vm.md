Time goes and our online magazine started hiring writers and editors. Soon they gonna  writing their articles and put it into internet. CTO decided that best platform for this would be WordPress, as it's used by many companies like [The Walt Disney Company](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/), [Tech Crunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/), [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/) and many more. Would be nice to prepare instance of the WordPress, so that authors can start writing.

## Task

* Setup Ubuntu on Virtual Machive (Virtual Box)
* install and setup nginx
* install and setup WordPress
* make sure that you can access admin panel in browser and can start creating new posts.

### Additional tasks if you feel that it was too easy.
1. Make sure that you can access only 80 ( and 443 port if HTTPS enabled) and MySQL port 3306 is open only inside your VM.
2. Know your software - Try to change default theme of your site, try to add some posts, comments. Inspect database, what changes do you see there, how does WP organise it's data

### Tips:

* After installing and setup Ubuntu you can save your state using VirtualBox snapshots. Next time if you would like to start from scratch step with installing Ubuntu could be skipped and loaded from snapshot.
* While installing WordPress try to record commands somewhere, you will need the for the future tasks.
