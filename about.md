When I started my way in administration, then in DevOps jobs I had great mentors who helped me to with learning a lot of things on practice. Later after getting more senior level I started to prepare on-boarding materials for newcomers, so that people who joined our team in 2 month become productive.

Right now I would like to do something similar and prepare materials for training for people that would like to try out technical tools and practices from DevOps.

The idea is following: I'm posting a quest and give details for it. Then people try to make this quest. I will gonna play "customer" role and will not give any manuals. You can google how to do it, read books, reddit, stack overflow, view youtube videos - whatever you want. I will answer your questions in comments and give my feedback. So you gonna learn by doing stuff rather then reading and copy pasting.
